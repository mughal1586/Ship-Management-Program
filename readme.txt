Ship Management Program

Description
This C++ program manages ship data, allowing the user to input and display information for multiple ships.

Features
-   Takes ship names, number of passengers, and weight capacity as input.
-   Stores and displays ship details, including name, passenger count, and capacity.
-   Utilizes classes and objects to represent ships.
-   Demonstrates the use of constructors, getters, and setters.

Code Structure
The code consists of three files:

-   `main.cpp`: Contains the main function, which handles user input and output, and creates Ship objects.
-   `Ship.cpp`:  Contains the implementation of the Ship class methods (constructors, getters, setters).
-   `header.h`: Contains the declaration of the Ship class. [cite: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 29, 30, 31]

Dependencies
-   iostream: For input/output operations. [cite: 29]
-   string: For handling string data (ship names). [cite: 29]

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, save the files with a .cpp extension (e.g., main.cpp, Ship.cpp, header.cpp) and use a C++ compiler.
